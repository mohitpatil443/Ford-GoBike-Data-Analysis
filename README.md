# Ford-GoBike-Data-Analysis

## ABOUT THE PROJECT :
The project focuses on Data Visualization and extensilvely on Exploratory Data Analysis and Explanatory Data Analysis.Exploring the dataset with the help of visualizations is the primary goal of this project.Explanatory Data Analysis  makes the visualizations presentable and hence more impactful.Exploring the data deals with histograms,countplots etc which give us a general idea of our data.

Three types of explorations are performed in this project :
- Univariate Explorations (Involving 1 feature)
- Bivariate Explorations (Involving 2 features)
- Multivaritae Explorations (Involving more than 2 features)

The goal of Explanatory data anlaysis in this project is to get polished and clean charts that reveal the insights without any distractions.

## TAKEAWAYS :
- Plotting Polished Visualizations
- Exploring the data visually
- Understanding the effects of outliers and minimizing their effects
- Better understanding of the visualization libraries

## MY EXPERIENCE :
The experience was quite interesting and the best part for me was the Exploratory and Explanatory analysis.Exploratory Analysis helped me to understand the data better within a small timeframe and getting the relationships between the various features.Explanatory Analysis enabled me to create clean,polished and impactful visualizations that are ready to be presented.
